 # Hello Hackers
  ## Intro To Commands
  In this challenge, you will invoke your first command! When you type a command and hit enter, the command will be invoked, as so:  
  ```
  hacker@dojo:~$ whoami  
hacker  
hacker@dojo:~$  
```
Here, the user executed the whoami command, which simply prints the username (hacker) to the terminal. When the command terminates, the shell once again displays the prompt, ready for the next command.  

In this level, invoke the hello command to get the flag! Keep in mind: commands in Linux are case sensitive: hello is different from HELLO.  
  ### Solve
  **Flag:** `pwn.college{km55fhjZTqZfzROAyrjObtJLAAC.QX3YjM1wiNyAzNzEzW}`  
```
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello  
Success! Here is your flag:  
pwn.college{km55fhjZTqZfzROAyrjObtJLAAC.QX3YjM1wiNyAzNzEzW}  
```


### New Learnings
I learned how to connect my terminals ssh key to pwn college and solve the websites problems through my computer. I also learned that typing whoami returns hacker.
